Once it is in and left to cool down, it will turn into its natural Viscous Elastic state: Not Solid, not liquid but viscous and will not dry up. Viscotaq Casing Filler 95 will also prevent internal corrosion of the casing pipe from Cathodic Protection currents (Due to the high electric insulation resistance preventing pass of electric currents). The Viscoaq Casing Filler 95 has high specific electrical insulation resistance which prevents the passing of electrical currents."

The compound remains in intimate contact with the substrate creating an impermeable homogeneous waterproof seal. When injected, the filler is a very effective solution for preventing corrosion of steel pipelines in steel casings. The expected water/Oxygen that is will cause corrosion of the operational steel pipeline and will also cause internal corrosion of the casing pipe. That is why we fill the annulus between the casing pipe and the operational pipe with VISCOTAQ CASING FILLER injection"

It is applied to structures such as rail bridges, tunnels, underground stations, foundations, and trackside infrastructure, where exposure to moisture, chlorides, and stray electrical currents accelerates corrosion. By controlling the electrochemical reactions on metal surfaces, CP significantly extends asset life, reduces maintenance costs, and enhances the long-term safety and reliability of rail networks"

It prevents corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete structures such as bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and stations, especially in environments exposed to chlorides, moisture, and stray currents. By mitigating steel corrosion at the source, CP preserves structural integrity, minimizes cracking and spalling of concrete, extends service life, and reduces the need for disruptive repairs in operating rail systems."
